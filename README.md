# Project-Library

Project Library was created to be an archive for books or literary works with the capabilities of changing the read status of each work. 

The Project took a longer duration than expected as there was an obstacle regarding creating a delete button to remove a previous iteration of a book added from the library. 

Overall, the library project was mostly created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

CSS animated background was a free resource from sliderrevolution @ https://www.sliderrevolution.com/resources/css-animated-background/.

The mouse pointers were created with cursor.cc through the Creative Commons license.
